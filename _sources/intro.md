```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
1. I found adding images difficult. The image does not show in the notebook only the website and that proves difficult to verify
2. Latex mathematical equation language was difficult to sort out. More practice for this would be helpful
3. Combination of admonitions was not difficult not had little practice.
